The Stripe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard.

Test mode secret keys have the prefix sk_test_ and live mode secret keys have the prefix sk_live_. Alternatively, you can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Use your API key by setting it in the initial configuration of stripe. The Node.js library will then automatically send this key in each request.

You can also set a per-request key with an option. This is often useful for Connect applications that use multiple API keys during the lifetime of a process. Methods on the returned object reuse the same API key.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
